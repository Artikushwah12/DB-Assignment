1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

Ans. Product table: Contains information about individual products, such as their name, description, price, etc. Each row in this table represents a unique product.
Product_category table: Holds information about different categories that products can belong to. Each row in this table represents a unique product category.
The relationship between the Product and Product_category entities is established through a one-to-many relationship.
How it works:
One-to-many relationship: This means that for each product, there is exactly one category it belongs to, but a category can have multiple products associated with it.
To implement this relationship:
In the Product table, there is likely a column let's call it category_id that serves as a foreign key, referencing the id column in the Product_category table. This category_id column indicates which category each product belongs to.
 it's a one-to-many relationship, the same category_id value in the Product table can appear multiple times, indicating that multiple products belong to the same category.

 2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

 Ans. To ensure that each product in the Product table has a valid category assigned to it, you can utilize a foreign key constraint in the database schema. A foreign key constraint enforces referential integrity, meaning it ensures that the values in a  a set of columns in one table correspond to the values in  a set of columns in another table.

 how you can implement it:

Define a Foreign Key Constraint: In the Product table, the category_id column would serve as a foreign key referencing the id column in the Product_category table.

Ensure Referential Integrity: By setting up this foreign key constraint, the database management system (DBMS) will ensure that any value entered into the category_id column of the Product table must already exist in the id column of the Product_category table. This means that only valid categories can be assigned to products.

Cascade Options: Additionally, you might want to consider cascade options for the foreign key constraint. For example, you can specify what action should be taken if a category is deleted or updated. Options might include cascading the deletion or updating the category_id in the Product table accordingly.
Example:-
ALTER TABLE Product
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category
FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
REFERENCES Product_category(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE;
This SQL statement adds a foreign key constraint (fk_product_category) to the category_id column in the Product table. It references the id column in the Product_category table. The ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE specify that if a category is deleted or updated, the changes should be cascaded to the Product table.
